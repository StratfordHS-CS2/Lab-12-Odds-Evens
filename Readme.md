# Lab 12 - Odds and Evens

## Lab Goal
This lab was designed to give you practice reading and writing arrays.

## Instructions
* Complete the method `count()` so it will count the number of even or odd values in the array passed.
* Complete the method `getAllEvens()` so it will return an array containing only the even values in the array passed.
  - You will have to use `count()` to figure out how long the array should be since you can't change the length of an array once it has been created.
* Complete the method `getAllOdds()` so it will return an array containing only the odd values in the array passed.
  - You will have to use `count()` to figure out how long the array should be since you can't change the length of an array once it has been created.
* You may edit the `main()` method to add additional situations for you to test.
* Complete all javadoc comment with the proper tags.

## Relevant ThinkJava Section
* [Arrays](http://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/html/thinkjava6009.html)

## Notes
* The Checkstyle config url is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* Make sure you modify the link at the top of your **Readme.md** to reflect your username if you want the badge at the top to represent the status of your code.

## Grading
* 30 - `count` works correctly
* 30 - `getAllEvens` works correctly
* 30 - `getAllOdds` works correctly
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
